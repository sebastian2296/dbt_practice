# What is DBT?

* Stands for Data Build Tool: Helps us with the transformation of the data after EL steps.

* Uses SQL syntax to deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD and documentation

# How does dbt work? 

* It adds a modeling layer on top of the DW layer where data is transformed. The derived model is persisted back to the data warehouse.

* each model is .sql file. Basically it's a SELECT statement without DDL or DML. It's a file that dbt will compile and run in our DWH.
