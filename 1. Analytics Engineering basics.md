# What is analytics engineering?

Fills the gap between to data roles: Data Engineer and Data Analyst

* Data Engineer: prepares and mantain the infraestructure the data team needs.
* Data Analyst: Uses data on that infraestructure to answer questions and solve problems.

* **Analytics Engineer**: introduces the good software engineering practices to the efforts of data analysts and data scientists.

# Tools

Data Loading: FiveTran, stich
Data Storing: cloud datawarehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
Data Modelling: dbt or Dataform
Data Presentation: PoweBI, Google DataStudio

## Data Modeling Concepts

**ETL**: Extract, transform and load to the DW
    * Slightly more stable and compliant data analysis
    * Higher Storage and compute costs
**ELT**: Extract, load and transform once the data is in the DataWarehouse

    * Faster and more flexible data analysis
    * Lower cost and lower maintenance 

## Kimball's Dimensional Modelling

**Objective**: 
* Deliver data understandable to the business users
* Deliver fast query performance

**Approach**
* Prioritise user understandability and query performance over non redundant data (3NF)

## Elements of Dimensional Modelling

**Fact Tables**

* Measurements, metrics or facts
* Corresponds to a business process
* "verbs"

**Dimensions Tables**

* Corresponds to a business entity
* Provides context to a business process
* "Nouns"

Fact tables and dimension tables constitute what is known as *Star Schema*.

## Architecture of Dimensional Modelling

**Stage Area**
* Contains the raw data
* Not meant to be exposed to everyone

**Processing Area**
* From raw data to data models
* Focuses on efficiency
* Ensures standards

**Presentation Area**
* Final presentation of the data
* Exposure to business stakeholder
